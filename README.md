# Kolmogorov Arnold Networks - Unsupervised Learning Task and Convolutional KANS 

- Conda Environment Setup
```python
conda create --name pykan-env python=3.9.7
conda activate pykan-env
pip install git+https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan.git  # For GitHub installation
# or
pip install pykan  # For PyPI installation
```
- For all the requirements 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Unsupervised Learning task: 
The unsupervised learning task is in the file `My Unsupervised Example.ipynb`. 

### Convolutional: 
The convolutional kan example is developed in `My Experiment KCNN.ipynb` which is in the folder 
`Convolutional-KANs-master` which is in `Convolutioanl_KAN`. In particular the FairNet used 
is defined in the folder `architectures_28x28` in the file `SimpleModels.py`.
